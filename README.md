# 🤖 CodeceptJS + Playwright E2E Tests of a HomeLab

This project uses [CodeceptJS](https://codecept.io/) with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for automated end-to-end testing of a local HomeLab on Ubuntu, running [CasaOS](https://www.casaos.io/) as the container management interface. [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/), [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), and [Scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) run as Docker containers orchestrated via CasaOS. 

A sample [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) pipeline configuration is also included for continuous test execution and artifact reporting. An additional Jenkins file might be used for optional Telegram bot notifications (success + failure) and sending screenshots (.png) and logs (.txt) as individual files(not zipped).

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
# Run all tests
npx codeceptjs run

# Run all tests with steps output
npx codeceptjs run --steps

# Run all tests in headless mode with steps
HEADLESS=true npx codeceptjs run --steps

# Run tests with a specific tag
npx codeceptjs run --grep @getTemperature

# Rebuild type definitions
npx codeceptjs run def

# Run tests and generate a mochawesome report
npx codeceptjs run --reporter mochawesome
```

## 🚀 Git
```bash

# List all the remote repositories associated with your local Git repository
git remote -v

# Update the URL of the remote repository named origin
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/eugeneburdukov/codeceptjs-playwright-homelab.git

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b exampleBranch      

# Stage changes
git add .   

# Check status
git status        

# Commit changes
git commit -m "added features"

# Push to remote
git push origin exampleBranch    
```

## 🚀 Telegram bot

```bash
Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for [`@BotFather`](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Start a chat and send the command:
3. Follow the prompts to set a name and username for your bot.
4. Once created, you'll receive a **Bot Token**. It will look like this: 123456789:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11

Save this token securely — you'll need it for sending messages.

Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

1. Start a chat with your newly created bot.
2. Send any message (e.g., “Hello”).
3. In your browser, go to: https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/getUpdates

Replace `<YourBotToken>` with the token you got from BotFather.
4. In the JSON response, look for the `chat` object:
```json
{
  "chat": {
    "id": 500732916,
    "first_name": "Eugene",
    ...
  }
}

That id value (e.g., 500732916) is your chat_id.
```
